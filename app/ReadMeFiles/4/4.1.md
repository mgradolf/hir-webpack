# Web Config Project
[Web Config](https://github.com/jxntm/hir-webconfig) project is intended to customize forms and tables by user configurations.

This project contains json files against almost all the forms and tables.

For forms, what happens normally is that each form field represent a `fieldName` in the payload of the corresponding submit api. In the config project, user will provide configurations against each `fieldName` and in the webadmin, the form field will be configured accordingly. Details on how a Form can be configured  can be found below:
1. [Metadriven form](4.2.md)
2. [Custom form](4.3.md)

For tables, it is the columns usually that represent a fieldName in corresponding get api. Details on how a Table can be configured  can be found:
1. [Table Columns meta](4.4.md).
